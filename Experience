Moeez Ahmad -> I don't have any prior experience with CI/CD.

Experience from prior internships and continuous development cycles within the projects I worked on.  People
continuosuly would merge new code in to the project so being a pro with git and ADO was absolutely neccessary.

Zach -> I worked with Ci/CD through Jenkins at my current internship. Our codebase was entirely automated from build to deployments.
